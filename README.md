## NVIDIA RAPIDS: Open-Source GPU Data Science on Azure


Traditional machine-learning workloads have yet to be GPU-accelerated the way deep learning and other neural net methods have. RAPIDS aims to change that, while maintaining the ease of use of the PyData ecosystem. The goal is to build a ridiculously fast open-source data science platform that allows practitioners to explore data, train ML algorithms and build applications while primarily staying in GPU memory. 

Materials contained here will provide a hands-on introduction to RAPIDS. It will begin with a brief introduction to RAPIDS and Azure ML (10-15 minutes). The remainder of the time will be a hands-on session on how to use RAPIDS to process and train a ML model.

We have two tracks:

1. `notebooks/intro` introduces the concepts of GPU computing and contrasts the runs with CPU
2. `notebooks/deep_dive` builds on the introductory scripts and provides more examples on how to extend and distrubute the workloads
